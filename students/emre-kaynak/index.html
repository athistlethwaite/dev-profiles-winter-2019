            <p>Hey there, name is Emre Kaynak. I was born in 94 and raised in Istanbul Turkey where there are wonderful things such as: good food, cool places to visit and lots of angry people yelling at eachother while being stuck in traffic. After graduating from collage and getting my degree on Electrical and Electronics Engineering last year, I have spent the summer wondering around the US, also lived in NY for a while    with friends who study there.</p>
            <h2>Why did I decide to     go Red?</h2>
            <p>Because I have decided that persuing a career as a software engineer would best suit me and Red was a good place to get started. I also thought living abord for few months, meeting new people and seeing new cultures could be a nice idea.</p>
            <h2>Here is the biggest mystery surrounding my existance</h2>
            <p> I dont consume any fruits or vegetables. Almost like a reverse vegan except its not like I am a huge meat fanatic either. I just don't like to taste anything new, I don't even try anything new. In fact if I were to list out every type of food I have ever had, I bet I could list them out right here. If have any guesses on how much you think I can sustain a healthy life or what kind of psychological disorder would cause this kind of behaviour, feel free to share them with me. The way I see it, my mother did not insist enough on me as a child to consume different kinds of food. I was stubborn, she must have gave up at some point right?</p>
