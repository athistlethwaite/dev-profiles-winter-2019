 <h2>About me</h2>

 <p> I was going to school at Kwantlen Polytechnic University before I came to RED. I am planning to resume my education at BCIT after I finish the program(s) here. Interesting facts about me is that I am also trying to learn multiple languages like Korean,Chinese and Japanese as a hobby. My goal is to be fluent by 30 years old in all 3 languages and travel all around Asia with no problems.</p>
