                   <p>During my 8 month solo backpacking trip last year, I met a couple on a beach in Indonesia, who told me about their travels.. 3 years of travel to be exact. </p>
                     <p>After interrogating them, begging to know their secret to long term travel, I learned they were developers, and quickly became obsessed with it, beginning code courses online immediately after.</p>

               <div class="skills"><h4 class="under">Here's some extremely random facts about me:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I once rapped in front of 20,000+ people about Canada wearing a neon teal wig and pink fuzzy fez.</li>
                        <li>I trekked for 3 weeks in Nepal to the highest lake in the world, but got altitude sickness the day of the summit.</li>
                        <li>I know how to say hello and thank you in 7 different asian languages (which, to my surprise, has yet to come in handy).</li>
                        <li>While hitchiking in Thailand, I was picked up by a Thai military officer (who had a beer in hand), and he drove me 4 hours to my final destination.</li>
                    </ul>
