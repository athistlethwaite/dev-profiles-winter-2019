<h2>Some Stuff About Me</h2>
<p>Howdy, folks. My name is Jasmine Barzegar and I'm from Montreal originally,
    but I grew up in Coquitlam, BC. I was working at 1-800-GOT-JUNK?
    before coming to RED as a B2B Sales Agent. Yawn.
</p>
<h2>Cool Stuff?</h2>
    <p>I do a lot of gaming - probably more than I like to admit.<br> Some of
    my favourites include:
</p>

    <ul>
    
        <li>League of Legends</li>
        <li>Diablo (all 3)</li>
        <li>Life is Strange</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also love anything and everything horror.
</p>
<h2>Travels</h2>
<p>I've traveled many places within the past couple years - some include:
    Boston, various parts of England - but my most favourite was Japan.
    <br>Japan has such a rich culture, and each city is so different from the
next. So many friendly people and lots of great food. </p>

        This was my favourite place.</a></p>

</br>
<h2>Random Stuff</h2>
<p>Secret talent, now that's a real head scratcher. I can only whistle
    inwards - so that's mainly just weird. Other than that, my hopes after
    this program is to find a really awesome job. Ultimately, I want to be
    able to travel and work at the same time.
