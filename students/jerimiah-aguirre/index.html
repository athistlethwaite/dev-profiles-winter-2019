           <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">My name is Jeremiah. My hometown is Toronto. 
         I was homeschooled all throughout elementary and high school.  
         Outdoors is where I love to be. I like backpacking, hiking, mountainbiking, 
         and most other outdoor activities! I have been working as a lifeguard between high school and this course.
         I am here taking this course to learn about something I have found an interest in. 
         Now to dive into the world of programming!</p>

       <div id="why">
           <h3>Why RED</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">I chose RED because I wanted a course that wasn't long and that I could learn the skills
                I needed for application development. I like the fact that this is an intesive course that
                gets through all the information in six months.
            </p>

            <h4>After RED</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 18px">I love to travel, so I plan to start out working for someone else to gain some expririance.
                    After a year, I would like to become a freelance programmer that is working from home and during my
                    travels!!
